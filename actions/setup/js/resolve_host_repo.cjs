/**
 * Resolves the target repository and ref for the activation job checkout.
 *
 * Uses GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF to determine the platform (host) repository and branch/ref
 * regardless of the triggering event. This fixes cross-repo activation for event-driven
 * relays (e.g. on: issue_comment, on: push) where github.event_name is NOT 'workflow_call',
 * so the expression introduced in #20301 incorrectly fell back to github.repository
 * (the caller's repo) instead of the platform repo.
 *
 * GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF always reflects the currently executing workflow file, not the
 * triggering event. Its format is:
 *   owner/repo/.github/workflows/file.yml@refs/heads/main
 *
 * When the platform workflow runs cross-repo (called via uses:), GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF
 * starts with the platform repo slug, while GITHUB_REPOSITORY is the caller repo.
 * Comparing the two lets us detect cross-repo invocations without relying on event_name.
 *
 * In a caller-hosted relay pinned to a feature branch (e.g. uses: platform/.github/workflows/
 * gateway.lock.yml@feature-branch), the @feature-branch portion is encoded in
 * GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF. Emitting it as target_ref allows the activation checkout to use
 * the correct branch rather than the platform repo's default branch.
 *
 * SEC-005: The targetRepo and targetRef values are resolved solely from trusted system
 * environment variables (GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF, GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_REF) set by the
 * GitHub Actions runtime. They are not derived from user-supplied input, so no allowlist
 * check is required in this handler.
 *
 * @safe-outputs-exempt SEC-005: values sourced from trusted runtime env vars only
