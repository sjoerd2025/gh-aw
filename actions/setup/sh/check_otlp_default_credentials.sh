#
# check_otlp_default_credentials.sh - Validate enterprise OTLP default configuration
#
# Emitted only for workflows whose OTLP endpoint comes from the enterprise default
# environment (vars.GH_AW_DEFAULT_OTLP_ENDPOINT / secrets.GH_AW_DEFAULT_OTLP_HEADERS)
# instead of `observability.otlp` frontmatter.
#
# Behaviour:
#   - Endpoint empty  -> no-op, telemetry export is simply disabled.
#   - Endpoint set and headers set -> no-op.
#   - Endpoint set but headers empty -> fail, so a misconfigured organization or
#     enterprise default is reported instead of silently sending unauthenticated
#     telemetry.
#
# Secret values are never printed; only their presence is reported.
#
# Environment variables read:
#   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT - resolved endpoint (may be empty)
#   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS  - resolved exporter headers (may be empty)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Configuration is usable (or telemetry is disabled)
#   1 - Endpoint configured without credentials
