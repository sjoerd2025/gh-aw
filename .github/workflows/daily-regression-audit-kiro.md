# Daily Regression Audit

Analyze recent CI workflow runs to surface patterns in test failures and regressions.

## Step 1 — Fetch recent workflow runs

Use the GitHub MCP `list_workflow_runs` tool on `${{ github.repository }}` with:
- `workflow_id: ci.yml` (or the main CI workflow)
- `per_page: 20`
- `status: completed`

Record the last 20 run conclusions (success / failure / cancelled).

## Step 2 — Identify failure rate

Calculate:
- Total runs in the set
- Failure count and percentage
- Consecutive failure streak (if any)

If failure rate is below 10% and no streak exists, skip to Step 4 with a "healthy" conclusion.

## Step 3 — Inspect failed runs

For the most recent 3 failed runs, use `list_workflow_jobs` to get the jobs and then
`get_job_logs` to retrieve failing job output (tail 200 lines). Look for:
- Repeated error messages across runs (regression patterns)
- New failures that appear only in recent runs (potential regressions introduced recently)
- Flaky tests vs. consistent failures

Summarize the top 2–3 failure patterns found.

When parsing JSON from MCP tool output or local files, use `jq` (not inline `python3 -c`/heredoc parsing).
If a tool/command is denied for this step, do not retry near-identical variants: after 2 denied attempts for the
same intent, stop and call `missing-tool` with the denied command and required capability.

## Step 4 — Check for open regression issues

Use `list_issues` on `${{ github.repository }}` with `labels: ["bug","regression"]` and
`state: open`, `perPage: 5`. Record issue numbers and titles.

## Step 5 — Report

Use the `reporting` skill to format the report body. Use `###` (or lower) headers only — never
`#` or `##`. Keep the failure rate and recommended action visible at the top; wrap the full
failure pattern details and raw job log excerpts in a
`<details><summary><b>Failure Details</b></summary>` block.

Use the `create_issue` safe-output tool to post the daily audit:

- **Title**: `[regression] Daily CI Regression Audit — ${{ github.run_id }}`
- **Body**:
  - `### Summary` with CI failure rate (last 20 runs) and recommended action (investigate /
    monitor / no action)
  - `<details><summary><b>Failure Details</b></summary>` wrapping top failure patterns (or "No
    regressions detected") and open regression/bug issues

If CI is fully healthy (failure rate < 10%, no streak, no new patterns), call `noop` with
`"CI health is good — no regressions detected."`.
