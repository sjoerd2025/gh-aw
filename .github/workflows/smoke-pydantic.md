# Smoke Test: Pydantic AI Engine Validation

## Test Requirements

1. **Model Connectivity Testing**: Answer the question "What is 2 + 2?" in a single short line.
2. **MCP Tool Testing**: Confirm that the `safeoutputs` MCP tools are available to you.
3. **Coder Toolset Testing**: Use your `read_file` tool to read `README.md` from the repository root and quote its first line verbatim. Do not shell out and do not guess the content — this test only passes when the file tool returns it.

## Output

**ALWAYS create an issue** using the `create_issue` safe-output tool:
- Title: "Smoke Test: Pydantic AI - ${{ github.run_id }}"
- Body should include:
  - Test results (✅ or ❌ for each test), including the quoted first line of `README.md`
  - Overall status: PASS or FAIL
  - Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}

**Only if this workflow was triggered by a pull_request event**: Use the `add_comment` safe-output tool to add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the triggering pull request (omit the `item_number` parameter to auto-target the triggering PR) containing:
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL

If all tests pass and this workflow was triggered by a pull_request event, use the `add_labels` safe-output tool to add the label `smoke-pydantic` to the pull request (omit the `item_number` parameter to auto-target the triggering PR).
