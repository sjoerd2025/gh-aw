# Semgrep MCP Server
# Static analysis and security scanning tool

Semgrep is a fast, open-source static analysis tool for finding bugs, detecting security vulnerabilities, and enforcing code standards. It supports multiple languages and custom rules.

Documentation: https://semgrep.dev/

## Available Tools

The Semgrep MCP server provides the following tools for code analysis:

- semgrep_rule_schema: Retrieves the schema required to write a Semgrep rule, lists available fields, and verifies rule syntax
- get_supported_languages: Lists all programming languages supported by Semgrep
- semgrep_scan: Scans code files for security vulnerabilities, bugs, and code quality issues using default rules
- semgrep_scan_local: Performs scans on local files and returns results in JSON format
- semgrep_scan_with_custom_rule: Runs a scan using a custom rule on provided code and returns findings
- semgrep_findings: Fetches findings from the Semgrep AppSec Platform API (requires Semgrep Cloud authentication)

## Basic Usage

To use Semgrep in your workflow, simply import this shared configuration:

```yaml
imports:
  - shared/mcp/semgrep.md
```

The MCP server will enable the agent to perform static analysis on code, including:
- Security vulnerability detection
- Bug finding
- Code quality checks
- Custom rule validation
- Language-specific pattern matching

## Example Patterns

Security Scanning:
```
Use semgrep to scan the repository for SQL injection vulnerabilities
```

Custom Rule Testing:
```
Test this custom Semgrep rule against the code in src/auth.go
```

Language Support:
```
Check which languages are supported by Semgrep for our multi-language repository
```
