# Re-enable schedule when a patched semgrep image is available and the container definition in shared/mcp/semgrep.md is restored.

    question: Did the agent complete a Semgrep security scan and report on the findings?
  - id: alert_created_or_noop
    question: Was a code scanning alert created for real security findings, or does the agent output confirm no vulnerabilities were found?
  - id: output_format_adherence
    question: Does the findings report match the writing style expected for the assigned semgrep_output_format variant (e.g., short active-voice sentences with one fact per sentence when the variant is "ste")?

Scan the repository for SQL injection vulnerabilities using Semgrep.

{{#if experiments.semgrep_output_format == 'bullet_list' }}
Report each finding as a flat bullet point in this format:
- **[SEVERITY]** `<file>:<line>` — Rule: `<rule_id>` — <message>

Create one code scanning alert per finding.
{{/if}}
{{#if experiments.semgrep_output_format == 'structured_sections' }}
Structure your findings report with:
1. A summary table: | Severity | Count |
2. Sections grouped by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low), then by rule ID
3. For each finding: file path, line number, rule, and recommended fix

Create one code scanning alert per finding.
{{/if}}
{{#if experiments.semgrep_output_format == 'prose' }}
Write a narrative security assessment describing the vulnerability patterns found. Embed specific findings (file, line, rule) within the prose. Conclude with a prioritized remediation list.

Create one code scanning alert per finding.
{{/if}}
{{#if experiments.semgrep_output_format == 'ste' }}
Write your findings report in Simplified Technical English (STE):
- Use short sentences. Limit each sentence to 20 words or fewer.
- Write one fact or instruction per sentence.
- Use active voice and present tense.
- Use simple, familiar words. Do not use jargon.
- Spell out each acronym on first use.

Report each finding in this format:
- **[SEVERITY]** `<file>:<line>` — Rule: `<rule_id>`. [One short sentence describing the issue.] [One short sentence with the recommended fix.]

Create one code scanning alert per finding.
{{/if}}


### Output Format

Use `###` (or lower) headers only.

Structure reports as: overview → key metrics/issues → collapsible detail → next actions.

Wrap long content with `<details><summary><b>View Details</b></summary>...</details>`.
