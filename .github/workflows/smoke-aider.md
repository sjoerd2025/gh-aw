# Smoke Test: Aider Engine Validation

Aider has no MCP client support, so this smoke test exercises only the CLI-native
capabilities: prompt delivery, shell commands, and file editing. Safe outputs are
emitted through the `safeoutputs` MCP CLI.

## Test Requirements

1. **File Writing Testing**: Create a test file `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-test-aider-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Aider" (create the directory if it doesn't exist)
2. **Bash Tool Testing**: Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back)
3. **Repository Access Testing**: Run `git log --oneline -1` in the repository checkout and confirm a commit is reported

## Output

**ALWAYS create an issue** with `safeoutputs create_issue`, for example
`safeoutputs create_issue --title "..." --body "..."`:
- Title: "Smoke Test: Aider - ${{ github.run_id }}"
- Body should include:
  - Test results (✅ or ❌ for each test)
  - Overall status: PASS or FAIL
  - Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}

**Only if this workflow was triggered by a pull_request event**: invoke
`safeoutputs add_comment --body "..."` with a **very brief**
comment (max 5-10 lines) containing:
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL

If all tests pass and this workflow was triggered by a pull_request event, also invoke
`safeoutputs add_labels --labels "smoke-aider"`.
