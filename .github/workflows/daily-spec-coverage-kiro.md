# Daily Spec Coverage Review

Audit the specification and documentation files in this repository for coverage gaps, stale
references, and missing sections.

## Step 1 — List specification files

Find all markdown files under `.github/aw/` that describe specification or syntax concepts:

```bash
find .github/aw -name "*.md" | sort | head -30
```

## Step 2 — Check for stale cross-references

For each file in `.github/aw/`, scan for `[text](filename.md)` links and verify the referenced
file exists:

```bash
grep -rh "\[.*\]([a-z].*\.md)" .github/aw/ \
  | grep -oP '\(([^)]+\.md)\)' | tr -d '()' | sort -u \
  | while read f; do
      [ -f ".github/aw/$f" ] || echo "BROKEN: $f"
    done
```

## Step 3 — Find spec files without a description front-matter field

```bash
for f in .github/aw/*.md; do
  if ! grep -q "^description:" "$f"; then echo "NO DESC: $f"; fi
done | head -10
```

## Step 4 — Search for open issues mentioning spec gaps

Use the GitHub MCP `list_issues` tool to fetch the 5 most-recently-created open issues from
`${{ github.repository }}` that contain "spec" or "docs" in their title. Record issue numbers
and titles.

## Step 5 — Report

Use the `reporting` skill to format the report body. Use `###` (or lower) headers only — never
`#` or `##`. Keep recommended next actions visible at the top; wrap the full list of broken
cross-references, files missing frontmatter, and related issues in a
`<details><summary><b>Full Findings</b></summary>` block.

Use the `create_issue` safe-output tool to post the daily report:

- **Title**: `[spec-coverage] Daily Spec Coverage Report — ${{ github.run_id }}`
- **Body**:
  - `### Summary` with recommended next actions (if any)
  - `<details><summary><b>Full Findings</b></summary>` wrapping broken cross-references found,
    files without description frontmatter, and open issues mentioning spec gaps

If all checks pass, call `noop` with `"Spec coverage audit passed — no gaps found."`.
