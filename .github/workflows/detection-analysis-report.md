# Detection Analysis Report

You are the Detection Analysis Agent. Your goal is to analyze the last 24 hours of agentic workflow runs, identify misconfigured workflows related to the `gh-aw-detection` feature, and produce a comparison chart between regular runs and detection-enabled runs.

## Current Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Report window**: last 24 full hours ending at workflow start (UTC)

## 📊 Detection Comparison Chart

Generate a comparison chart showing how detection-enabled runs differ from regular runs:

1. **Detection Feature Comparison**: A side-by-side grouped bar chart with two groups — "Regular Runs" (`gh-aw-detection: false`, i.e. the feature was explicitly opted out) and "Detection Runs" (`gh-aw-detection` enabled, which is the default when the flag is absent) — plotting these metrics for each group:
   - Total run count (left y-axis)
   - Success rate % (right y-axis, line overlay)
   - Average token usage (secondary chart or annotation)

Save to: `/tmp/gh-aw/python/charts/detection_comparison.png`

Upload the chart using the `upload_asset` safe-output tool with the absolute path. Record the returned asset URL and embed it in the discussion body.

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1 — Logs

{{#runtime-import? shared/aw-logs-24h-fetch-prompt.md}}

Each run's `aw_info.json` contains `features["gh-aw-detection"]` (boolean), `status`, `total_tokens`, and `engine_id`. Use `features.gh-aw-detection` directly — do not infer detection status from `.lock.yml` files. Note that the key is only present when the workflow sets it explicitly; when it is missing, detection is **enabled** (the default).

Each run's `run_summary.json` contains `job_details`, an array of `{name, conclusion, steps: [{name, status, conclusion}]}` for every GitHub Actions job in the run (e.g. `agent`, `detection`, `activation`). Use this for step-level failure attribution in Rule 3 below.

### Analyze Runs

In a single pass over the run directories at `/tmp/gh-aw/aw-mcp/logs`, classify and aggregate all runs:

**Classify each run** using `features.gh-aw-detection` from `aw_info.json`. The `gh-aw-detection` feature is **enabled by default**, so an absent or unset value means detection is enabled:
- **Detection-enabled**: value is `true`, absent, or unset
- **Regular**: value is explicitly `false`

Collect per-run: `workflow_name`, `status`, `total_tokens`, `engine_id`, `detection_enabled`, and (from `run_summary.json.job_details`) the `agent` job's `conclusion` and the `detection` job's `conclusion`.

**Flag a workflow as misconfigured** when any of the following apply:
1. `gh-aw-detection: false` on a workflow with >3 total runs in the last 7 days
2. Run has detection enabled **and** the `detection` job in `job_details` itself has a failing `conclusion` (e.g. `failure`) — i.e. the detection job actually ran and a detection-specific step errored. Use `job_details` to attribute the failure precisely:
   - Look up the `agent` and `detection` jobs by name in `job_details`.
   - If the `agent` job is absent from `job_details` or has `conclusion: "skipped"`/`"cancelled"` (consistent with `TokenUsage: 0` and `ErrorCount: 0` in the run summary), the agent job never executed — this is **not** a detection-step failure; do not flag under rule 2 (it may indicate a trigger/permission issue worth noting separately, but is out of scope for this rule).
   - Only flag rule 2 when the `detection` job (or a step within it) itself shows a failing conclusion in `job_details`. This job-level conclusion is the sole signal for rule 2 — do not fall back to `TokenUsage`/`ErrorCount` heuristics, which cannot distinguish a detection-step failure from an agent job that never started.
3. Workflow alternates between detection-enabled and detection-disabled within the 24h window

Do **not** flag a workflow merely because it lacks an explicit `gh-aw-detection: true` entry — that is the default configuration for most workflows and is not a misconfiguration.

For each misconfigured workflow, record: `workflow_name`, `misconfiguration_type`, `run_count`, `example_run_id`, `recommended_fix`.

**Save** aggregated metrics to `/tmp/gh-aw/python/data/metrics.json`:

```json
{
  "regular_runs": <count>,
  "detection_runs": <count>,
  "regular_success_rate": <percent>,
  "detection_success_rate": <percent>,
  "regular_failure_count": <count>,
  "detection_failure_count": <count>,
  "regular_avg_tokens": <mean>,
  "detection_avg_tokens": <mean>,
  "misconfigured_count": <count>
}
```

### Step 5 — Generate Chart

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/detection_comparison.py \
  --metrics /tmp/gh-aw/python/data/metrics.json \
  --output /tmp/gh-aw/python/charts/detection_comparison.png
```

Upload the chart using the `upload_asset` safe-output tool. Record the returned asset URL and embed it in the discussion body.

### Step 6 — Historical Trending

Use the `update-detection-trending` agent to append today's metrics to the cache-memory trending history and optionally generate a trend chart.

If `/tmp/gh-aw/python/charts/detection_trend.png` was generated, upload it with `upload_asset` and embed in the report under "View Historical Trend".

## Report Structure

Publish a discussion using the configured safe-output. Structure the body as:

### Summary
- Window evaluated: last 24 full hours (UTC)
- Total runs analyzed: N
- Detection-enabled runs: N (X%)
- Regular runs: N (Y%)
- Misconfigured workflows found: N

> [!WARNING] if any misconfigured workflows were found, else > [!NOTE]

### Comparison Chart

### Misconfigured Workflows
For each misconfigured workflow, include a table row with:
- Workflow name
- Misconfiguration type
- Run count
- Recommended fix

If none found, state: "No misconfigured workflows detected in this window."

<details>
<summary>View All Run Metrics</summary>

Full per-workflow breakdown table with detection status, success rate, and token usage.

</details>

<details>
<summary>View Historical Trend</summary>

[Embed trend chart here if available]

</details>

### Recommendations
Actionable next steps for any misconfigured workflows or patterns.

## No-Op Criteria

Call `noop` with a brief explanation when:
- No workflow runs exist in the last 24 hours
- State the evaluated window in the no-op message

Example: `noop("No workflow runs found in the last 24 full hours (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ to YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)")`

model: small
description: Appends detection metrics to cache-memory trending history and generates a trend chart when ≥7 days of data exist
---
Append today's detection metrics to the cache-memory trending history store.

Create the directory before writing:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/trending/detection-metrics
```

Read `/tmp/gh-aw/python/data/metrics.json` and append one JSON line to `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/trending/detection-metrics/history.jsonl`:

```json
{"timestamp": "<ISO-8601 UTC>", "regular_runs": N, "detection_runs": N, "regular_success_rate": X.X, "detection_success_rate": X.X, "regular_avg_tokens": X, "detection_avg_tokens": X, "misconfigured_count": N}
```

If the history file has ≥7 entries, generate a 30-day trend chart at `/tmp/gh-aw/python/charts/detection_trend.png`:
- Line chart: `regular_runs` vs. `detection_runs` per day for the last 30 days
- Shaded area band for the detection success rate
- Style: seaborn whitegrid, 12×7 inches, 150 DPI
