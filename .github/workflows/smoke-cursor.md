# Smoke Test: Cursor Engine Validation

## Test Requirements

1. **GitHub MCP Testing**: Use GitHub MCP tools to fetch details of exactly 2 merged pull requests from ${{ github.repository }} (title and number only)
2. **File Writing Testing**: Create a test file `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-test-cursor-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Cursor at $(date)" (create the directory if it doesn't exist)
3. **Bash Tool Testing**: Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back)
4. **Build gh-aw**: Run `GOCACHE=/tmp/gh-aw/agent/go-cache GOMODCACHE=/tmp/gh-aw/agent/go-mod make build` to verify the agent can successfully build the gh-aw project. If the command fails, mark this test as failed and report the failure.

## Output

**ALWAYS create an issue** with a concise summary of the smoke test run:
- Title: "Smoke Test: Cursor - ${{ github.run_id }}"
- Body should include:
  - Test results (PASS or FAIL for each test)
  - Overall status: PASS or FAIL
  - Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
  - Timestamp

**Only if this workflow was triggered by a pull_request event**: Use the `add_comment` tool to add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the triggering pull request (omit the `item_number` parameter to auto-target the triggering PR) with:
- PASS or FAIL for each test result
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL

If all tests pass and this workflow was triggered by a pull_request event, use the `add_labels` safe-output tool to add the label `smoke-cursor` to the pull request (omit the `item_number` parameter to auto-target the triggering PR).
