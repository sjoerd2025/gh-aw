# Daily Schema Consistency Audit

Scan the workflow schema and key JSON config files in this repository for consistency drift and
missing required fields.

## Step 1 — Identify schema files

Find all `*.json` schema files under `pkg/parser/schemas/` and list them:

```bash
find pkg/parser/schemas -name "*.json" | sort
```

## Step 2 — Validate referenced `$defs` are used

For the primary schema (`main_workflow_schema.json`), check that every definition declared in
`$defs` is referenced at least once in the schema body:

```bash
jq -r '
  .["$defs"] | keys[] as $k |
  if (tostring | test("\"\\($k)\"") | not) then $k else empty end
' pkg/parser/schemas/main_workflow_schema.json 2>/dev/null || echo "File not found"
```

Report any unreferenced `$defs` entries.

## Step 3 — Check `required` completeness

For each object in the schema that has `properties`, verify whether a `required` array is
present. List objects that define `properties` but have no `required` field — these may allow
optional fields that should be mandatory.

```bash
jq '[.. | objects | select(has("properties") and (has("required") | not)) | path] | length' \
  pkg/parser/schemas/main_workflow_schema.json 2>/dev/null || echo "0"
```

## Step 4 — Report

Use the `reporting` skill to format the report body. Use `###` (or lower) headers only — never
`#` or `##`. Keep the overall status visible at the top; wrap the full list of unreferenced
`$defs` and objects missing `required` in a
`<details><summary><b>Full Findings</b></summary>` block.

Use the `create_issue` safe-output tool to post the audit:

- **Title**: `[schema-audit] Daily Schema Consistency Report — ${{ github.run_id }}`
- **Body**:
  - `### Summary` with overall status: 🟢 (no issues) / 🟡 (minor) / 🔴 (action needed)
  - `<details><summary><b>Full Findings</b></summary>` wrapping unreferenced `$defs` count and
    names, and objects missing `required` arrays

If all checks pass with no issues, call `noop` with `"Schema consistency audit passed — no issues found."`.
