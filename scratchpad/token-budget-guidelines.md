# Token Budget Guidelines for High-Cost Workflows

## Overview

This document establishes token budget targets and optimization strategies for agentic workflows that consume significant Copilot tokens. These guidelines help maintain cost predictability while preserving analysis quality.

## Purpose

- **Cost Control**: Prevent unbounded token consumption in expensive workflows
- **Predictability**: Establish expected token ranges per workflow run
- **Quality**: Maintain useful outputs while reducing unnecessary verbosity
- **Monitoring**: Enable tracking and alerting when budgets are exceeded

## Token Budget Configuration

### Available Controls

#### 1. `max-turns` (For Claude/Custom Engines Only)

Limits the number of conversation rounds between the agent and the AI engine.

**Important:** `max-turns` is **only supported by Claude and Custom engines**, not Copilot. For Copilot workflows, use prompt optimization and timeout controls instead.

```yaml
---
# Claude engine with max-turns
engine:
  id: claude
  max-turns: 30  # Recommended for research/analysis workflows
---
```

```yaml
---
# Custom engine with max-turns
engine:
  id: custom
  max-turns: 25  # Recommended for CI/automation workflows
---
```

**How it works:**
- Each "turn" is one round-trip: agent request → AI response
- Includes all tool calls and responses within that turn
- Workflow terminates when max-turns is reached
- Earlier termination if task completes

**Engine Support:**
- ✅ **Claude**: Fully supported
- ✅ **Custom**: Fully supported
- ❌ **Copilot**: Not supported - use prompt optimization instead
- ❌ **Codex**: Not supported

#### 2. `timeout-minutes` (Secondary Control)

Prevents workflows from running indefinitely due to unexpected loops or delays.

```yaml
---
timeout-minutes: 180  # 3 hours - research workflows
timeout-minutes: 45   # 45 minutes - CI cleanup workflows
timeout-minutes: 20   # 20 minutes - single-step automation
---
```

#### 3. Prompt Optimization (Critical for Copilot Workflows)

**Primary method for Copilot token budget control** since max-turns is not available.

Explicit instructions in workflow prompts to reduce token consumption:

**Output Size Limits:**
```markdown
## Output Guidelines

- Keep responses concise and actionable
- Main report should be under 1000 words
- Use progressive disclosure (details/summary tags)
- Summarize findings instead of exhaustive documentation
```

**Scope Reduction:**
```markdown
## Execution Scope

- Test 6-8 representative scenarios (not all scenarios)
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Prioritize critical issues over complete coverage
```

**Efficiency Instructions:**
```markdown
## Efficiency Guidelines

- Avoid verbose explanations - focus on actions
- If stuck after 3 attempts, document and move on
- Complete analysis within reasonable time
- Aim for systematic approach with minimal iteration
```

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Reduce Iteration Scope

**Before:**
```markdown
For each scenario (15-20 scenarios), test the agent response...
```

**After:**
```markdown
Test a representative subset of 6-8 scenarios to reduce token consumption...
```

**Impact**: 40-60% reduction in Phase 3 token usage

### 2. Output Compression

**Before:**
```markdown
### Detailed Analysis
[5000 word detailed report with all scenario details]
```

**After:**
```markdown
### Key Findings (3-5 bullet points max)
<details>
<summary><b>View Detailed Scenario Analysis</b></summary>
[Detailed content hidden by default]
</details>
```

**Impact**: 30-40% reduction in documentation generation tokens

### 3. Early Termination Conditions

**Before:**
```markdown
Work through each step systematically.
```

**After:**
```markdown
If all checks pass, stop immediately and create PR.
If stuck on an issue after 3 attempts, document it and move on.
```

**Impact**: 10-20% reduction by avoiding stuck states

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

Use HTML `<details>` tags to reduce initial output verbosity:

```markdown
<details>
<summary><b>View Detailed Examples</b></summary>

[Verbose content that AI generates once but doesn't repeatedly reference]

</details>
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Recommended Metrics

1. **Tokens per Run**: Track actual token consumption per workflow execution
2. **Cost per Run**: Calculate estimated cost based on token usage
3. **Budget Compliance**: % of runs within target budget
4. **Quality Metrics**: Ensure optimization doesn't degrade output quality

### Alert Thresholds

See the **Alert Thresholds (Updated)** table in the [Workflow-Specific Budgets](#workflow-specific-budgets) section above for all workflows including Issue Monster, CI Optimization Coach, and Step Name Alignment.

### Monitoring Tools

Use the daily Copilot token report workflow:
- Location: `.github/workflows/daily-copilot-token-report.md`
- Generates per-workflow statistics
- Tracks historical trends
- Identifies cost anomalies

## Implementation Checklist

When adding token budgets to a workflow:

- [ ] Set `max-turns` based on workflow complexity
- [ ] Adjust `timeout-minutes` to reasonable completion time
- [ ] Add output size limits in prompt instructions
- [ ] Add efficiency guidelines for agent behavior
- [ ] Document budget targets in workflow comments
- [ ] Consider scope reduction opportunities
- [ ] Add early termination conditions
- [ ] Test to verify budget compliance
- [ ] Monitor actual token consumption
- [ ] Adjust thresholds based on real-world data

## Best Practices

### DO:
