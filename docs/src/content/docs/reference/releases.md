GitHub Agentic Workflows uses a two-layer versioning model: the **CLI extension** (`gh aw`) that you run locally or in CI, and the **compiled `.lock.yml` files** that run in GitHub Actions. Each layer has independent version tracking.

## Release Channels

The gh-aw installer resolves version aliases from [`.github/aw/releases.json`](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/aw/releases.json) before downloading a binary. Three options are available:

| Channel | Alias | Behavior |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Stable** (default) | `stable` | Resolves to the latest fully-vetted release — recommended for most users |
| **Latest** | `latest` | Always resolves to the most recent GitHub release, including recently shipped features |
| **Pinned** | `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` | A fixed release tag — use when you need exact reproducibility |

### Installing a channel

```bash
# Stable (default — no version flag needed)
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install-gh-aw.sh | bash

# Latest
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install-gh-aw.sh | bash -s latest

# Specific version
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install-gh-aw.sh | bash -s v0.64.5
```

Via the GitHub CLI extension manager:

```bash
gh extension install github/gh-aw          # stable (default)
gh extension install github/gh-aw@v0.64.5  # pinned version
```

> [!TIP]
> Use `stable` for production repositories and CI. Use `latest` when you want to try new features as soon as they ship.

### Checking and updating your version

```bash
gh aw version                   # Show currently installed version

gh extension upgrade gh-aw      # Upgrade to the latest release
```

### Pinning in GitHub Actions

Use the [`setup-cli` action](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/actions/setup-cli/README.md) to install a specific version in CI:

```yaml
- name: Install gh-aw
  uses: github/gh-aw/actions/setup-cli@main
  with:
    version: v0.64.5
```

## Version Enforcement in Compiled Workflows

Every compiled `.lock.yml` embeds the gh-aw version used to produce it:

```yaml
GH_AW_INFO_AWF_VERSION: "v0.64.5"
```

At runtime, the activation job fetches `.github/aw/releases.json` and compares the embedded version against three policies:

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `blockedVersions` | Workflow fails — the compiled version has been revoked |
| `minimumVersion` | Workflow fails — the compiled version is too old |
| `minRecommendedVersion` | Workflow warns — an upgrade is recommended but not enforced |

This means that if you compiled a workflow months ago with an older version of `gh aw`, you may see a warning (or failure) asking you to recompile with a newer version. Run `gh aw upgrade` to bring all workflows up to date.

## How Lock Files Are Pinned

When `gh aw compile` generates a `.lock.yml`, it pins every GitHub Actions reference to a commit SHA:

```yaml
# Generated lock file (do not edit manually)
uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6.0.2
```

SHA pins are immutable — unlike tags, they cannot be silently redirected to a different commit. This protects workflows from supply-chain attacks.

The resolved SHA mappings are cached in `.github/aw/actions-lock.json`. Commit this file to version control so that all contributors and automated tools (including GitHub Copilot Coding Agent) produce identical lock files without needing broad API access.

To refresh action pins:

```bash
gh aw update-actions   # Update actions-lock.json to latest SHAs
gh aw compile          # Recompile workflows using the refreshed pins
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never edit `.lock.yml` files manually and do not merge Dependabot PRs that target `github/gh-aw-actions` references in lock files. These pins are managed entirely by the compiler. See [Compilation Process](/gh-aw/reference/compilation-process/#the-gh-aw-actions-repository) for details.

## `upgrade` vs `update`

These two commands address different concerns:

### `gh aw upgrade` — update the tooling

`upgrade` brings the repository's agentic workflow infrastructure up to date with the current version of `gh aw`. It:

1. Self-updates the `gh aw` extension to the latest version
2. Regenerates the dispatcher agent file (like `gh aw init`)
3. Applies codemods to fix deprecated syntax across all workflow markdown files
4. Updates GitHub Actions versions in `actions-lock.json`
5. Recompiles all workflows to produce fresh `.lock.yml` files

Run `upgrade` after installing a new version of `gh aw`, or periodically to keep your repository current.

```bash
gh aw upgrade                          # Upgrade everything
gh aw upgrade --no-actions             # Skip updating action pins
gh aw upgrade --audit                  # Check dependency health without upgrading
gh aw upgrade --create-pull-request    # Open a PR with the changes
```

### `gh aw update` — update workflow content from source

`update` fetches the latest version of workflow markdown files from their upstream source repositories. It only applies to workflows that declare a [`source` field](/gh-aw/reference/imports/) in their frontmatter.

```yaml
# Example workflow with a source field
source: github/gh-aw/.github/workflows/shared/ci-doctor.md@v1
```

By default, `update` merges upstream changes with your local modifications (3-way merge). Use `--no-merge` to overwrite local changes entirely.

```bash
gh aw update                           # Update all workflows that have a source field
gh aw update ci-doctor                 # Update a specific workflow
gh aw update ci-doctor --no-merge      # Override local changes with upstream
gh aw update ci-doctor --major         # Allow major version updates
gh aw update --create-pull-request     # Open a PR with the changes
```

### Summary

| Command | What it updates | When to use |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| `gh aw upgrade` | Tooling: agent files, codemods, action pins, compiled lock files | After installing a new `gh aw` version; periodic maintenance |
| `gh aw update` | Workflow content: markdown files sourced from other repositories | When upstream workflows have released new versions |

> [!TIP]
> Both commands support `--create-pull-request` to open a review PR instead of committing directly.
