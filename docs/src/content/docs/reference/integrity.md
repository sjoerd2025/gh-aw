Integrity filtering (`tools.github.min-integrity`) controls which GitHub content an agent can access during a workflow run. Rather than filtering by permissions, it filters by **trust**: the author association of an issue, pull request, or comment, and whether that content has been merged into the main branch.

## How It Works

The MCP gateway intercepts tool calls to GitHub and applies integrity checks to each piece of content returned. If an item's integrity level is below the configured minimum, the gateway removes it before the AI engine sees it. This happens transparently — the agent receives a reduced result set, and filtered items are logged as `DIFC_FILTERED` events for later inspection.

## Configuration

Set `min-integrity` under `tools.github` in your workflow frontmatter:

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: approved
```

`min-integrity` can be specified alone. When `repos` is omitted, it defaults to `"all"`. If `repos` is also specified, both fields must be present.

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    repos: "myorg/*"
    min-integrity: approved
```

## Integrity Levels

The full integrity hierarchy, from highest to lowest:

```text
merged > approved > unapproved > none > blocked
```

| Level | What qualifies at this level |
|-------|------------------------------|
| `merged` | Pull requests that have been merged, and commits reachable from the default branch (any author) |
| `approved` | Objects authored by `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR`; non-fork PRs on public repos; all items in private repos; trusted platform bots (e.g., dependabot) |
| `unapproved` | Objects authored by `CONTRIBUTOR` or `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR` |
| `none` | All objects, including `FIRST_TIMER` and users with no association (`NONE`) |
| `blocked` | Items authored by users in `blocked-users` — always denied, cannot be promoted |

The four configurable levels (`merged`, `approved`, `unapproved`, `none`) are cumulative and ordered from most restrictive to least. Setting `min-integrity: approved` means only items at `approved` level **or higher** (`merged`) reach the agent. Items at `unapproved` or `none` are filtered out.

`blocked` is not a configurable `min-integrity` value — it is assigned automatically to items from users in the `blocked-users` list and is always denied regardless of the configured threshold.

**`merged`** is the strictest configurable level. A pull request qualifies as `merged` when it has been merged into the target branch. Commits qualify when they are reachable from the default branch. This is useful for workflows that should only act on production content.

**`approved`** corresponds to users who have a formal trust relationship with the repository: owners, members, and collaborators. Items in private repositories are automatically elevated to `approved` (since only collaborators can access them). Recognized platform bots such as dependabot and github-actions also receive `approved` integrity. This is the most common choice for public repository workflows.

**`unapproved`** includes contributors who have had code merged before, as well as first-time contributors. Appropriate when community participation is welcome and the workflow's outputs are reviewed before being applied.

**`none`** allows all content through. Use this deliberately, with appropriate safeguards, for workflows designed to process untrusted input — such as triage bots or spam detection.

**`blocked`** sits below `none` and represents an explicit negative trust decision. Items at this level are unconditionally denied — even `min-integrity: none` does not allow them through. See [Blocking specific users](#blocking-specific-users) below.

## Adjusting Integrity Per-Item

Beyond setting a minimum level, you can override integrity for specific authors or labels.

### Blocking specific users

`blocked-users` unconditionally blocks content from listed GitHub usernames, regardless of `min-integrity` or any labels. Blocked items receive an effective integrity of `blocked` (below `none`) and are always denied.

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: none
    blocked-users:
      - "spam-bot"
      - "compromised-account"
```

Use this to suppress content from known-bad accounts — automated bots, compromised users, or external contributors pending security review.

### Promoting items via labels

`approval-labels` promotes items bearing any listed GitHub label to `approved` integrity, enabling human-review workflows where a trusted reviewer labels content to signal it is safe for the agent.

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: approved
    approval-labels:
      - "human-reviewed"
      - "safe-for-agent"
```

This is useful when a workflow's `min-integrity` would normally filter out external contributions, but a maintainer can label specific items to let them through.

Promotion only raises integrity — it never lowers it. An item already at `merged` stays at `merged`. Blocked-user exclusion always takes precedence: a blocked user's items remain blocked even if they carry an approval label.

### Effective integrity computation

The gateway computes each item's effective integrity in this order:

1. **Start** with the base integrity level from GitHub metadata (author association, merge status, repo visibility).
2. **If the author is in `blocked-users`**: effective integrity → `blocked` (always denied).
3. **Else if the item has a label in `approval-labels`**: effective integrity → max(base, `approved`).
4. **Else**: effective integrity → base.

The `min-integrity` threshold check is applied after this computation.

## Default Behavior

For **public repositories**, if no `min-integrity` is configured, the runtime automatically applies `min-integrity: approved`. This protects public workflows even when additional authentication has not been set up.

For **private and internal repositories**, no guard policy is applied automatically. Content from all users is accessible by default.

## Choosing a Level

The right level depends on who you want the agent to see content from:

- **Workflows that automate code review or apply changes**: `merged` or `approved` — only act on trusted content.
- **Workflows that respond to maintainers and trusted contributors**: `approved` — a common, safe default for most workflows.
- **Community triage or planning workflows**: `unapproved` — allow contributor input while excluding anonymous or first-time interactions.
- **Public-data workflows or spam detection**: `none` — see all activity, but ensure the workflow's outputs are not directly applied without review.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting `min-integrity: none` on a public repository disables the automatic protection. Only use it when the workflow is designed to handle untrusted input.

## Examples

**Allow only merged content:**

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    repos: "all"
    min-integrity: merged
```

**Trusted contributors only (typical for a public repository workflow):**

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: approved
```

**Allow all community contributions (for a triage workflow):**

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: unapproved
```

**Explicitly disable filtering on a public repository, apart from blocked users:**

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: none
```

**Scope to specific organizations with integrity filtering:**

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    mode: remote
    toolsets: [repos, issues, pull_requests]
    repos:
      - "myorg/*"
      - "partner/shared-repo"
    min-integrity: approved
```

**Block specific users while allowing all other content:**

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: none
    blocked-users:
      - "known-spam-bot"
```

**Human-review gate for external contributions:**

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: approved
    approval-labels:
      - "agent-approved"
      - "human-reviewed"
```

## In Logs and Reports

When an item is filtered by the integrity check, the MCP gateway records a `DIFC_FILTERED` event in the run's `gateway.jsonl` log. Each event includes:

- **Server**: the MCP server that returned the filtered content
- **Tool**: the tool call that produced it (e.g., `list_issues`, `get_pull_request`)
- **User**: the login of the content's author
- **Reason**: a description such as `"Resource has lower integrity than agent requires."`
- **Integrity tags**: the tags assigned to the item that caused it to be filtered
- **Author association**: the GitHub author association (`CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIMER`, etc.)

When gateway metrics are displayed, filtered events appear in a **DIFC Filtered Events** table alongside the standard server usage table:

```text
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DIFC Filtered Events                                                               │
├────────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬──────────────────────────────────-┤
│ Server         │ Tool          │ User          │ Reason                            │
├────────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
│ github         │ list_issues   │ new-user      │ Resource has lower integrity than │
│                │               │               │ agent requires.                   │
└────────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┘
```

The `Total DIFC Filtered` count in the summary line shows how many items were suppressed during the run.

### Filtering Logs by Integrity Events

To download only runs that had integrity-filtered content, use the `--filtered-integrity` flag with the `logs` command:

```bash
gh aw logs --filtered-integrity
```

This is useful when investigating whether your `min-integrity` configuration is filtering expected content or when tuning the level after observing real traffic patterns.
