LabelOps uses GitHub labels as workflow triggers, metadata, and state markers. GitHub Agentic Workflows supports two distinct approaches to label-based triggers: `label_command` for command-style one-shot activation, and `names:` filtering for persistent label-state awareness.

## When to Use LabelOps

Use LabelOps for priority-based workflows (run checks when `priority: high` is added), stage transitions (trigger actions when moving between workflow states), specialized processing (different workflows for different label categories), and team coordination (automate handoffs between teams using labels).

## Label Command Trigger

The `label_command` trigger treats a label as a one-shot command: applying the label fires the workflow, and the label is **automatically removed** so it can be re-applied to re-trigger. This is the right choice when you want a label to mean "do this now" rather than "this item has this property."

```aw wrap
---
on:
  label_command: deploy
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: write
safe-outputs:
  add-comment:
    max: 1

# Deploy Preview

A `deploy` label was applied to this pull request. Build and deploy a preview environment and post the URL as a comment.

The matched label name is available as `${{ needs.activation.outputs.label_command }}` if needed to distinguish between multiple label commands.
```

After activation the `deploy` label is removed from the pull request, so a reviewer can apply it again to trigger another deployment without any cleanup step.

### Syntax

`label_command` accepts a shorthand string, a map with a single name, or a map with multiple names and an optional `events` restriction:

```yaml
# Shorthand — fires on issues, pull_request, and discussion
on: "label-command deploy"

# Map with a single name
on:
  label_command: deploy

# Restrict to specific event types
on:
  label_command:
    name: deploy
    events: [issues, pull_request]

# Multiple label names
on:
  label_command:
    names: [deploy, redeploy]
    events: [pull_request]

# Keep label after activation (persistent state, not one-shot command)
on:
  label_command:
    name: in-review
    remove_label: false
```

The `remove_label` field (boolean, default `true`) controls whether the matched label is removed after the workflow activates. Set it to `false` when the label represents a persistent state rather than a transient command — for example, to mark that an item is currently being processed without consuming the label. When `remove_label: false`, the `issues: write` / `pull-requests: write` permissions for label removal are not required.

The compiler generates `issues`, `pull_request`, and/or `discussion` events with `types: [labeled]`, filtered to the named labels. It also adds a `workflow_dispatch` trigger with an `item_number` input so you can test the workflow manually without applying a real label.

### Accessing the matched label

The label that triggered the workflow is exposed as an output of the activation job:

```
${{ needs.activation.outputs.label_command }}
```

This is useful when a workflow handles multiple label commands and needs to branch on which one was applied.

### Combining with slash commands

`label_command` can be combined with `slash_command:` in the same workflow. The two triggers are OR'd — the workflow activates when either condition is met:

```yaml
on:
  slash_command: deploy
  label_command:
    name: deploy
    events: [pull_request]
```

This lets a workflow be triggered both by a `/deploy` comment and by applying a `deploy` label, sharing the same agent logic.

> [!NOTE]
> The automatic label removal requires `issues: write` or `pull-requests: write` permission (depending on item type). Add the relevant permission to your frontmatter when using `label_command`.

## Label Filtering

Use `names:` filtering when you want the workflow to run whenever a label is present on an item and the label should remain attached. This is suitable for monitoring label state rather than reacting to a transient command.

GitHub Agentic Workflows allows you to filter `labeled` and `unlabeled` events to trigger only for specific label names using the `names` field:

```aw wrap
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]
    names: [bug, critical, security]
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
safe-outputs:
  add-comment:
    max: 1

# Critical Issue Handler

When a critical label is added to an issue, analyze the severity and provide immediate triage guidance.

Check the issue for:
- Impact scope and affected users
- Reproduction steps
- Related dependencies or systems
- Recommended priority level

Respond with a comment outlining next steps and recommended actions.
```

This workflow activates only when the `bug`, `critical`, or `security` labels are added to an issue, not for other label changes. The labels remain on the issue after the workflow runs.

### Choosing between `label_command` and `names:` filtering

| | `label_command` | `names:` filtering |
|---|---|---|
| Label lifecycle | Removed automatically after trigger | Stays on the item |
| Re-triggerable | Yes — reapply the label | Only on the next `labeled` event |
| Typical use | "Do this now" commands | State-based routing |
| Supported items | Issues, pull requests, discussions | Issues, pull requests |

### Label Filter Syntax

The `names` field accepts a single label (`names: urgent`) or an array (`names: [priority, needs-review, blocked]`). It works with both `issues` and `pull_request` events, and the field is compiled into a conditional `if` expression in the final workflow YAML.

## Common LabelOps Patterns

**Priority Escalation**: Trigger workflows when high-priority labels (`P0`, `critical`, `urgent`) are added. The AI analyzes severity, notifies team leads, and provides escalation guidance with SLA compliance requirements.

**Label-Based Triage**: Respond to triage label changes (`needs-triage`, `triaged`) by analyzing issues and suggesting appropriate categorization, priority levels, affected components, and whether more information is needed.

**Security Automation**: When security labels are applied, automatically check for sensitive information disclosure, trigger security review processes, and ensure compliance with responsible disclosure policies.

**Release Management**: Track release-blocking issues by analyzing timeline impact, identifying blockers, generating release note content, and assessing testing requirements when release labels are applied.

## AI-Powered LabelOps

**Automatic Label Suggestions**: AI analyzes new issues to suggest and apply appropriate labels for issue type, priority level, affected components, and special categories. Configure allowed labels in `safe-outputs` to control which labels can be automatically applied.

**Component-Based Auto-Labeling**: Automatically identify affected components by analyzing file paths, features, API endpoints, and UI elements mentioned in issues, then apply relevant component labels.

**Label Consolidation**: Schedule periodic label audits to identify duplicates, unused labels, inconsistent naming, and consolidation opportunities. AI analyzes label usage patterns and creates recommendations for cleanup and standardization.

## Best Practices

Use specific label names in filters to avoid unwanted triggers (prefer `ready-for-review` over generic `ready`). Combine with safe outputs to maintain security while automating label-based workflows. Document label meanings in a LABELS.md file or use GitHub label descriptions. Limit automation scope by filtering for explicit labels like `automation-enabled`.

Address label explosion with AI-powered periodic audits for consolidation. Prevent ambiguous labels through AI suggestions and clear descriptions. Reduce manual upkeep by implementing AI-powered automatic labeling on issue creation and updates.
