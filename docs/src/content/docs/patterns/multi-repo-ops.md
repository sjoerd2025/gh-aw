MultiRepoOps extends operational automation patterns (IssueOps, ChatOps, etc.) across multiple GitHub repositories. Using cross-repository safe outputs and secure authentication, MultiRepoOps enables coordinating work between related projects-creating tracking issues in central repos, synchronizing features to sub-repositories, and enforcing organization-wide policies-all through AI-powered workflows.

## When to Use MultiRepoOps

- **Feature synchronization** - Propagate changes from main repositories to sub-repos or forks
- **Hub-and-spoke tracking** - Centralize issue tracking across component repositories
- **Organization-wide enforcement** - Roll out security patches, policy updates, or dependency changes across all repos
- **Monorepo alternatives** - Coordinate packages or services living in separate repositories
- **Upstream/downstream workflows** - Sync features between upstream dependencies and downstream consumers

## How It Works

MultiRepoOps workflows use the `target-repo` parameter on safe outputs to create issues, pull requests, and comments in external repositories. Combined with GitHub API toolsets for querying remote repos and proper authentication (PAT or GitHub App tokens), workflows can coordinate complex multi-repository operations automatically.

```aw wrap
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
safe-outputs:
  github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_AW_CROSS_REPO_PAT }}
  create-issue:
    target-repo: "org/tracking-repo"
    title-prefix: "[component-a] "
    labels: [tracking, multi-repo]
---

# Cross-Repo Issue Tracker

When issues are created in component repositories, automatically create tracking issues in the central coordination repo.

Analyze the issue and create a tracking issue that:
- Links back to the original component issue
- Summarizes the problem and impact
- Tags relevant teams across the organization
- Provides context for cross-component coordination
```

## Authentication for Cross-Repo Access

Cross-repository operations require authentication beyond the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which is scoped to the current repository only.

### Personal Access Token (PAT)

Configure a Personal Access Token with access to target repositories:

```yaml wrap
safe-outputs:
  github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_AW_CROSS_REPO_PAT }}
  create-issue:
    target-repo: "org/tracking-repo"
```

**Required Permissions:**

The PAT needs permissions **only on target repositories** where you want to create resources, not on the source repository where the workflow runs.

- Repository access to target repos (public or private)
- `contents: write`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write` (depending on operations)

> [!TIP]
> Security Best Practice
> If you only need to read from one repo and write to another, scope your PAT to have read access on the source and write access only on target repositories.

### GitHub App Installation Token

For enhanced security, use GitHub Apps with automatic token revocation. GitHub App tokens provide per-job minting, automatic revocation after job completion, fine-grained permissions, and better attribution than long-lived PATs.

See [Using a GitHub App for Authentication](/gh-aw/reference/auth/#using-a-github-app-for-authentication) for complete configuration including specific repository scoping and org-wide access.

## Common MultiRepoOps Patterns

### Hub-and-Spoke Issue Tracking

Central repository aggregates issues from multiple component repositories:

```text
Component Repo A ──┐
Component Repo B ──┼──> Central Tracker
Component Repo C ──┘
```

Each component workflow creates tracking issues in the central repo using `target-repo` parameter.

### Upstream-to-Downstream Sync

Main repository propagates changes to downstream repositories:

```text
Main Repo ──> Sub-Repo Alpha
          ──> Sub-Repo Beta
          ──> Sub-Repo Gamma
```

Use cross-repo pull requests with `create-pull-request` safe output and `target-repo` configuration.

### Organization-Wide Coordination

Single workflow creates issues across multiple repositories:

```text
Control Workflow ──> Repo 1 (tracking issue)
                 ──> Repo 2 (tracking issue)
                 ──> Repo 3 (tracking issue)
```

Agent generates multiple tracking issues with different `target-repo` values (up to configured `max` limit).

## Cross-Repository Safe Outputs

Most safe output types support the `target-repo` parameter for cross-repository operations. **Without `target-repo`, these safe outputs operate on the repository where the workflow is running.**

| Safe Output | Cross-Repo Support | Example Use Case |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| `create-issue` | ✅ | Create tracking issues in central repo |
| `add-comment` | ✅ | Comment on issues in other repos |
| `update-issue` | ✅ | Update issue status across repos |
| `add-labels` | ✅ | Label issues in target repos |
| `create-pull-request` | ✅ | Create PRs in downstream repos |
| `create-discussion` | ✅ | Create discussions in any repo |
| `create-agent-session` | ✅ | Create tasks in target repos |
| `update-release` | ✅ | Update release notes across repos |

## Teaching Agents Multi-Repo Access

Enable GitHub toolsets to allow agents to query multiple repositories:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [repos, issues, pull_requests, actions]
    github-token: ${{ secrets.CROSS_REPO_PAT }}  # Required for cross-repo reading
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When reading from repositories other than the workflow's repository, you must configure additional authentication. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` only has access to the current repository. Use a PAT, GitHub App token, or the magic secret `GH_AW_GITHUB_MCP_SERVER_TOKEN`. See [GitHub Tools Reference](/gh-aw/reference/cross-repository/#cross-repository-reading) for details.

Agent instructions can reference remote repositories:

```markdown
Search for open issues in org/upstream-repo related to authentication.
Check the latest release notes from org/dependency-repo.
Compare code structure between this repo and org/reference-repo.
```

## Deterministic Multi-Repo Workflows

For direct repository access without agent involvement, use an AI engine with custom steps:

```aw wrap
---
engine:
  id: claude

steps:
  - name: Checkout main repo
    uses: actions/checkout@v6
    with:
      path: main-repo

  - name: Checkout secondary repo
    uses: actions/checkout@v6
    with:
      repository: org/secondary-repo
      token: ${{ secrets.GH_AW_CROSS_REPO_PAT }}
      path: secondary-repo

  - name: Compare and sync
    run: |
      # Deterministic sync logic
      rsync -av main-repo/shared/ secondary-repo/shared/
      cd secondary-repo
      git add .
      git commit -m "Sync from main repo"
      git push

# Deterministic Feature Sync

Workflow that directly checks out multiple repos and synchronizes files.
```

## Example Workflows

Explore detailed MultiRepoOps examples:

- **[Feature Synchronization](/gh-aw/examples/multi-repo/feature-sync/)** - Sync code changes from main repo to sub-repositories
- **[Cross-Repo Issue Tracking](/gh-aw/examples/multi-repo/issue-tracking/)** - Hub-and-spoke tracking architecture

## Best Practices

- **Authentication**: Use GitHub Apps for automatic token revocation; scope PATs minimally to required repositories; store tokens as GitHub secrets
- **Workflow design**: Set appropriate `max` limits; use meaningful title prefixes and consistent labels
- **Error handling**: Handle rate limits and permission failures; monitor workflow execution across repositories
- **Testing**: Start with public repositories, pilot a small subset, and verify configurations before full rollout
