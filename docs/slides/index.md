# Evolution: LLMs to SWE Agents

**2021: GitHub Copilot** - AI-powered code completion

**2022: ChatGPT** - Conversational AI assistant

**2023: LLMs & Web UI Generators** - Prompt to Web App

**2024: Agent CLIs** - Claude Code: File edit, bash

**2025: MCP, SKILLS.md** - Unified tooling

---

# CI/CD with GitHub Actions

YAML workflows stored in `.github/workflows/`, triggered on events like push, pull requests, or issues.

```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  issues: write # DANGER zone
jobs:
  agent:
    steps:
      - run: copilot -p "Summarize issue and respond in a comment."
```

# The "Lethal Trifecta" for AI Agents

AI agents become dangerous when these **three capabilities** combine:

- **Private data access**

- **Untrusted content**

- **External communication**

> <https://simonw.substack.com/p/the-lethal-trifecta-for-ai-agents>

---

# Useful Sandboxes: The Philosophy

## Safe by design. Useful by default.

> The best developer tools protect you from catastrophe while letting you build something real

---

# From Scratch to MakeCode

## Kid dev environments got here first

- **Scratch** — Block-based coding (MIT) — can't break anything important
- **MakeCode / pxt** — Hardware + game programming for beginners
- **BASIC** — First language for a generation of developers

These environments share one superpower:

> Protected from catastrophe — still building something **real and delightful**

---

# What Makes a Sandbox "Useful"?

## The beginner runtime principles

- **Guardrails without walls** — protected, not trapped
- **Immediate feedback** — actions produce visible results
- **Progressive disclosure** — start simple, grow into complexity
- **Real outputs** — even beginners ship something that matters
- **Delight** — the sandbox feels like a superpower, not a restriction

> The best sandboxes don't limit what's possible — they shape *how* it's possible

---

# Applying These Principles to Agentic Workflows

| Beginner Runtime | Agentic Workflows |
|---|---|
| Runs in the browser | Container isolation |
| Safe defaults | Read-only permissions |
| Guardrailed actions | Safe outputs |
| Real outputs | Issues, PRs, comments |
| Delightful UX | Natural language workflows |

> Same philosophy, enterprise scale

---

# Combine GitHub Actions and SWE Agents **SAFELY**

---

# Loved by Developers

```yaml
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  contents: read # read-only by default
safe-outputs:
  add-comment: # guardrails for write operations
---
Summarize issue and respond in a comment.
```

> Natural language → compiled to GitHub Actions YAML

---

# Trusted by Enterprises

## Safe by default

- **Containers**: Isolated GitHub Actions Jobs

- **Firewall**: Network Control

- **Minimal Permissions**: Read-only by default

- **MCP Gateway**: Secure tool access

- **Threat Detection**: Agentic detection of threats

- **Safe Outputs**: Deterministic, guardrailed outputs

- **Plan / Check / Act**: Human in the loop

---

# Compiled Action YAML

```yaml
jobs:
  activation:
    run: check authorization

  agent: needs[activation] # isolated container
    permissions: contents: read # read-only!
    run: copilot -p "Analyze package.json for breaking changes..."

  safe-outputs: needs[agent] # isolated container
    run: gh issue comment add ...
    permissions: issues: write
```

> Markdown workflows compiled to GitHub Actions YAML for auditability

---

# Safe Outputs

```yaml
---
on: 
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]
permissions: 
  contents: read
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
---
Check for breaking changes in package.json and create an issue.
```

**Security:** AI agents cannot directly write to GitHub. Safe-outputs validate AI responses and execute actions in isolated containers.

---

# Network Permissions

```yaml
---
on:
  pull_request:
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults  # Basic infrastructure
    - node      # NPM ecosystem
tools:
  web-fetch:
---
Fetch latest TypeScript docs and report findings in a comment.
```

> Control external access for security

---

# Safe Outputs → Copilot Handoff

```yaml
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    assignees: ["copilot"]
---
Analyze issue and break down into implementation tasks
```

> Triage agent → Creates tasks → @copilot implements → Review

---

# AI Engines

## Multiple AI providers supported

- **GitHub Copilot** (default, recommended)
- **Claude Code**
- **Codex**
- **Gemini CLI**

```yaml
engine: copilot  # sensible defaults
```

> GitHub Copilot offers MCP support and conversational workflows

---

# MCP Servers Configuration

```yaml
# GitHub MCP (recommended: use toolsets)
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [default]  # context, repos, issues, pull_requests

# Custom MCP servers
mcp-servers:
  bundle-analyzer:
    command: "node"
    args: ["path/to/mcp-server.js"]
    allowed: "*"
```

**MCP:** Extend AI with [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)

---

# Containerized, Firewalled MCPs

```yaml
mcp-servers:
  web-scraper:
    container: mcp/fetch
    network:
      allowed: ["npmjs.com", "*.jsdelivr.com"]
    allowed: ["fetch"]
```

**Defense in depth:** Container + network + permissions

---

# Monitoring & Optimization

```sh
# View recent runs
gh aw logs

# Filter by date range
gh aw logs --start-date -1w accessibility-review

# Generate the lock file for a workflow
gh aw compile
```

> Lock files (`.lock.yml`) ensure reproducibility and auditability

---

# Cache & Persistent Memory

## Speed up workflows and maintain context

```yaml
---
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]
tools:
  cache-memory:  # AI remembers across runs
---
Review this PR with context from previous reviews:
- Check for repeated issues
- Track improvement trends
- Reference past discussions
```

**Benefits:** Faster builds + contextual AI analysis

---

# Playwright + Upload Assets

```yaml
---
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [ready_for_review]
tools:
  playwright:      # Headless browser automation
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
  upload-asset:   # Attach screenshots to artifacts
---
Test the web application:
1. Navigate to the preview URL
2. Take screenshots of key pages
3. Check for visual regressions and responsive design
4. Create issue with findings and screenshots
```

**Use cases:** Visual regression, accessibility audits, E2E validation for SPAs

---

# Sanitized Context & Security

## Protect against prompt injection

```yaml
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
safe-outputs:
  add-comment:
---
# RECOMMENDED: Use sanitized context
Analyze this issue content (safely sanitized):
"${{ steps.sanitized.outputs.text }}"
```

**Auto-sanitization:** @mentions neutralized, bot triggers blocked, malicious URIs filtered

---

# Security Architecture

## Multi-layered defense in depth

- Container isolation for all components
- Network firewall controls at every layer
- Minimal permissions by default
- Separation of concerns (agent, tools, outputs)

# Security Layer 1: Coding Agent Sandbox

**Agent sandbox** — isolated container, read-only by default, limited system access

**Primary proxy/firewall** — filters outbound traffic, controls MCP Gateway access, enforces network allowlists

---

# Security Layer 2: MCP Gateway

**MCP Gateway (mcpg)** — central routing between agents and services

- Validates tool invocations and enforces permission boundaries
- Single point of control — no direct agent-to-service access
- Full audit trail for tool calls

---

# Security Layer 3: Tool Sandboxes

**MCP servers & skills** — each runs in its own container, non-root, dropped capabilities

**Secondary proxies** — egress filtering, domain allowlists, defense against data exfiltration

---

# Security Layer 4: Service Access

External services accessed only through proxies — multiple controls before reaching any service

> Defense in depth: if one layer is compromised, additional controls remain in place

---

# Security Features Summary

| Layer | Protection |
|---|---|
| **Containers** | VMs + sandboxes for agent, MCP servers, skills |
| **Network** | Proxy/firewall at every layer, domain allowlisting |
| **Permissions** | Read-only default, safe outputs for writes |
| **Supply Chain** | Pinned action SHAs, protected CI/CD files |
| **Integrity** | `min-integrity`, access & integrity metadata |
| **Monitoring** | Threat detection, audit logs, run analysis |

---

# Best Practices: Human in the Loop

**Manual Approval Gates:**
Critical operations require human review

```yaml
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]
  manual-approval: production
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
---
Analyze issue and create implementation PR
```

**Plan / Check / Act Pattern:**

- AI generates plan (read-only)
- Human reviews and approves
- Automated execution with safe outputs

---
